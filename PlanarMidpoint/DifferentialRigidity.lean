# Differential rigidity of planar symmetric cubic fields

On every open preconnected planar domain, an everywhere differentiable cubic
field satisfying the quartic obstruction equation is constant. The proof
includes the exceptional cones, transitions between loci, and zero values;
no continuity of the derivative is assumed.
