# Planar Euclidean midpoint rigidity

This proves the dimension-two case of Nielsen–Okamura Conjecture 9.1
(arXiv:2609.07551v2, Section 9). The midpoint hypothesis uses actual canonical
short geodesics of the two Euclidean dual connections. The proof includes
the construction of those local germs and their fourth-order obstruction.
